<!-- Concept -->
The Helix Project ([website](https://xavier2p.github.io/helix)) is a Patient Management System (PMS) specially built for Osteopaths purposes. You can find some popular features like:

+ Patient management (medical history, appointments, billing, ...)
+ Appointment management (personal and professional calendar ...)
+ Billing management (invoices, export to Excel, ...)
+ Multi-user management (with different roles for the whole cabinet)

All that features are available in a single application, with a simple and intuitive interface, and **for ever** free!

## Technical stack

The client is built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). To build the application, we use [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), a fast build tool for modern web apps.
For UI design, we use [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/), a React UI library with a simple API and great docs.
